Yet Another Gnome 2 Build Script
================================

This is another set of scripts for building GNOME 2.  They are still a
little rough around the edges, but may still be useful to you.

They don't enforce any particular checkout, build or install
directories for your gnome2 setup.  Currently, it doesn't handle
external modules that must be installed (such as gettext, libtool,
etc) -- those will need to be installed manually.

Once the dependency information is added, the script should be usable
for a stable gnome setup as well.

To install the scripts run "make install", and then copy
sample.jhbuildrc to ~/.jhbuildrc and edit to match your setup.  My rc
file is provided for reference as jamesh.jhbuildrc.


Using jhbuild
-------------

To build everything, just type 'jhbuild'.  Some useful options are:
  --no-cvs	Don't pull the sources from CVS.  Useful for building
		when not connected to the network.
  --no-build	Just update the source, don't build.
  --clean       Always rerun autogen and make clean before building a
		module.

When an error is encountered, you will be given a chance to fix the
problem.  You can choose to rerun that part of the build, start a
shell to give you a chance to fix things, give up on the module all
together, or ignore the error (useful for certain cvs errors).

If you give up on building a module, all modules that depend on it
will be skipped.  If you would prefer the build not to ask questions
on errors, you can pass the --no-interact switch, which is equivalent
to always choosing give up.


Module info
-----------

Information about how to build the modules is contained in the
moduleinfo.py file.  This file needs to be modified when dependencies
between modules change (usually, no change to the ~/.jhbuildrc will be
needed).
